This code provides a basic implementation of a shell in C++, demonstrating how a shell interacts with the terminal to handle basic functions such as user input in raw mode, command execution, pipe management, redirection, and maintaining command history.

Prerequisites :
To try out this code, it must be run in a Unix-based environment. Windows does not natively support commands like "fork", so you may use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for this purpose.

Execution :
First, navigate to the directory containing the code.

Then compile and run the shell program:

g++ main.cpp -o shell
./shell    

I will be uploading a doc for explaining this implementation soon, till then you can reffer from the comments of the code.

Happy Learning !!
